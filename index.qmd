I am a thoughtful, intellectually curious individual with a strong academic and professional foundation. I bring analytical rigor and strategic thinking to every task. As a teaching assistant, I am also committed to helping others succeed.

I am bilingual in Chinese and English. 我可以教你中文。 I enjoy basketball, skiing, and tennis, and bring the same dedication and curiosity to their personal interests as they do to their work.

I'm also a new single mom, seeking ways to balancing my studies and responsibilities with grade and resilience.
