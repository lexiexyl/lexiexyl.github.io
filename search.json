    "text": "I am a thoughtful, intellectually curious individual with a strong academic and professional foundation. With a background in finance and experience at a major tech company like Microsoft, they bring analytical rigor and strategic thinking to every task. Currently pursuing graduate studies in Project Management at Boston University, they are deeply engaged in understanding how data, decision-making frameworks, and organizational dynamics intersect.\nI am bilingual in Chinese and English. Outside of academics, I enjoy basketball, skiing, and tennis, and bring the same dedication and curiosity to their personal interests as they do to their work. I’m also a new parent, balancing my studies and responsibilities with admirable grace and resilience. As a teaching assistant, they are committed to helping others succeed, and often seek ways to improve systems and processes through AI and analytics."
